# Synthalingua Environment Setup Guide

This guide explains how to use the `set_up_env.exe` tool to set up and manage the Synthalingua environment. This tool is provided as a compiled executable for Windows users, so you do **not** need to run it with Python.

---

## What is `set_up_env.exe`?

`set_up_env.exe` is a one-stop setup utility for Synthalingua. It automates the download, installation, and configuration of all required tools:
- **FFmpeg** (audio/video processing)
- **yt-dlp** (video downloader)
- **7zr** (archive extractor)
- **Miniconda** (Python environment manager, for vocal isolation)
- **Demucs** (vocal isolation, optional)

It also creates a batch file (`ffmpeg_path.bat`) to set up your PATH and activate the correct environment for Synthalingua.

---

## How to Use `set_up_env.exe`

1. **Locate the Executable**
   - Find `set_up_env.exe` in your Synthalingua folder (usually in the main directory).

2. **DO NOT Run as Administrator (NOT Recommended)**
   - Click `set_up_env.exe` as is and just run.

3. **Follow the Prompts**
   - The tool is interactive. It will ask if you want to reuse existing tools, provide your own, or download fresh copies.
   - For a fresh install, just press Enter to accept defaults unless you have custom requirements.
   - **Miniconda Path Warning:**
     - It is strongly recommended to use the default Miniconda installation path.
     - If you must choose a custom location, make absolutely sure the path contains **NO SPACES**. Paths with spaces can cause installation and runtime errors with Miniconda and other tools.
     - The setup tool will warn you and prevent you from using a path with spaces.

---

## Command-Line Arguments

You can run `set_up_env.exe` from a terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) with the following options:

- `set_up_env.exe`  
  Basic setup (FFmpeg, yt-dlp, 7zr only)

- `set_up_env.exe --using_vocal_isolation`  
  Also installs Miniconda and Demucs for vocal isolation features

- `set_up_env.exe --reinstall`  
  Wipes tool folders/files and redownloads everything fresh

- `set_up_env.exe --reinstall --using_vocal_isolation`  
  Full reinstall, including vocal isolation tools

**Tip:** If you double-click the exe, it will prompt you interactively for these options.

---

## Keeping Your `data_whisper` Folder

The `data_whisper` folder contains your Miniconda environment and Demucs installation. To **preserve** your environment and avoid re-downloading large models or packages:

- **Do NOT use `--reinstall`** unless you want to wipe and start over.
- If prompted about removing `data_whisper` or Miniconda, choose **No** to keep your environment.
- You can safely update other tools (FFmpeg, yt-dlp, etc.) without affecting `data_whisper`.


### Example: Backing Up and Restoring Your Environment
#### Sample Interactive Session: Preserving Your Environment

When running `set_up_env.exe`, here's what you'll see and how to respond to preserve your environment:

**Fresh Install (First Time Running):**
```
üÜï Fresh installation detected!
For the best experience, we recommend setting up vocal isolation features.
Would you like to set up vocal isolation (demucs) along with the basic tools? (yes/no): yes

Miniconda will be installed to: C:\bin\Synthalingua\miniconda
Do you agree to install Miniconda to this path? (yes/no): yes

‚ö†Ô∏è  It is strongly recommended to use the default installation path for Miniconda.
   Changing the location is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.
   If you must choose a custom location, make sure the path contains NO SPACES.
Please enter a custom path for Miniconda installation (NO SPACES, recommended to keep the default): D:\My Custom Folder\miniconda
‚ùå Path cannot contain spaces. Please try again with a path that has NO SPACES.
Please enter a custom path for Miniconda installation (NO SPACES, recommended to keep the default): D:\MinicondaNoSpaces
```

**Existing Installation (Updating Tools):**
```
Found existing 7zr.exe. Use it or download fresh? (use/download): use
Do you already have FFmpeg? (yes/no): no
FFmpeg folder already exists, skipping download.
Do you already have yt-dlp? (yes/no): no
yt-dlp folder already exists, skipping download.
```

**Vocal Isolation Setup (Preserving Environment):**
```
A data_whisper environment already exists at C:\bin\Synthalingua\miniconda\envs\data_whisper.
Would you like to (k)eep, (r)ecreate, or (s)pecify a different environment? (keep/recreate/specify): keep
Using data_whisper environment at C:\bin\Synthalingua\miniconda\envs\data_whisper.
```

**Device Selection (During Setup):**
```
Synthalingua supports both CPU and GPU (CUDA) processing.
This affects both transcription and vocal isolation (demucs) performance.
Which device do you typically want to use with Synthalingua? (cpu/cuda): cuda
```

**Important:** Always answer `keep` when asked about environment options, and `yes` when asked about reusing assets. This preserves your models and packages.

To back up your environment:

1. Close all Synthalingua programs.
2. Copy the following folders to a safe location (e.g., an external drive or backup folder):
   - `data_whisper` (in your Synthalingua directory)
   - Miniconda install directory (default: `C:\bin\Synthalingua\miniconda`)

To restore your environment on the same or a new PC:

1. Copy both folders back to their original locations.
2. Run `set_up_env.exe` (without `--reinstall`) to update tool paths if needed.
3. Run `ffmpeg_path.bat` to activate the environment.

This will preserve all installed packages, models, and settings. You can use this method to migrate or recover your setup easily.

```

### Scenario 2: Updating Existing Installation (Preserving Environment)

```
Version 0.0.41
Config file already exists. Use --reinstall to set up again, or --using_vocal_isolation to add vocal isolation.
```

**To update tools while keeping your environment, run:**
```
set_up_env.exe --reinstall
```

**Then you'll see:**
```
Detected existing FFmpeg at C:\Synthalingua\downloaded_assets\ffmpeg. Reuse this asset? (yes/no): yes
Detected existing yt-dlp at C:\Synthalingua\downloaded_assets\yt-dlp_win. Reuse this asset? (yes/no): yes
Detected existing 7zr.exe at C:\Synthalingua\downloaded_assets\7zr.exe. Reuse this asset? (yes/no): yes
Detected existing Miniconda installation at C:\bin\Synthalingua\miniconda. Reuse this asset? (yes/no): yes

Miniconda is already installed at C:\bin\Synthalingua\miniconda.
Do you want to (w)ipe and reinstall Miniconda, or (k)eep and reuse it? (wipe/keep): keep

A data_whisper environment already exists at C:\bin\Synthalingua\miniconda\envs\data_whisper.
Would you like to (k)eep, (r)ecreate, or (s)pecify a different environment? (keep/recreate/specify): keep
Using data_whisper environment at C:\bin\Synthalingua\miniconda\envs\data_whisper.
```

### Scenario 3: Using Your Own Tools

```
Do you want to provide your own version of 7zr.exe? (yes/no): yes
Please enter the path to your 7zr.exe file: C:\MyTools\7zr.exe

Do you already have FFmpeg? (yes/no): yes
Do you want to use the system default FFmpeg? (yes/no): no
Please enter the path to your FFmpeg bin folder: C:\MyTools\ffmpeg\bin

Do you already have yt-dlp? (yes/no): yes
Do you want to use the system default yt-dlp? (yes/no): yes
```

**Key Points:**
- Always answer `yes` when asked about reusing assets to preserve your environment
- Answer `keep` when asked about wiping/keeping Miniconda installation
- Answer `keep` when asked about environment options to preserve your models and packages
- The script remembers your choices and won't re-download unless you specifically request it
- Use `--reinstall` to update tools while preserving your environment by choosing the preserve options

---

## Script Details & Advanced Usage

- **Interactive Prompts:** The tool will ask if you want to reuse, download, or provide your own versions of each tool. This helps avoid unnecessary downloads and lets you use custom builds.
- **Batch File Creation:** After setup, a `ffmpeg_path.bat` file is created. Run this batch file to set up your PATH and activate the correct environment for Synthalingua.
- **Vocal Isolation:** If you enable vocal isolation, the tool installs Miniconda and Demucs, and sets up a `data_whisper` environment. You can choose CPU or CUDA (GPU) support during setup.
- **Safe Reinstallation:** The `--reinstall` flag lets you wipe and redownload tools. You will be prompted before deleting important folders like `data_whisper`.
- **Custom Paths:** You can specify a custom Miniconda install path if you do not want to use the default.

## Manual Environment Updates & Package Management

Sometimes you may need to manually install or update packages in your `data_whisper` environment. This can happen when:
- A package installation fails during setup
- You need to reinstall corrupted packages
- New dependencies are required for features
- Conda fails to install a specific package

### Accessing Your Environment Manually

To manually work with your `data_whisper` environment:

1. **Open a terminal** (PowerShell, Command Prompt, or Git Bash)
2. **Navigate to your Synthalingua folder:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/Synthalingua_Main
   ```
3. **Activate the environment using the batch file:**
   ```bash
   ./ffmpeg_path.bat
   ```
   
   After running this, you should see `(data_whisper)` in your terminal prompt, indicating the environment is active.

### Installing Packages with pip

When conda fails to install a package or you need to reinstall something, use pip:

```bash
# Example: Installing diffq package that failed during setup
pip install diffq

# Example: Reinstalling a corrupted package
pip install --force-reinstall demucs

# Example: Installing a specific version
pip install torch==2.7.1

# Example: Upgrading a package to latest version
pip install --upgrade numpy
```

### Real-World Example

Here's a common scenario where manual installation is needed:

```bash
((data_whisper) ) 
Username@DESKTOP-TJ8OCSG MINGW64 /e/Synthalingua/Synthalingua_Main (refactor)
$ pip install diffq
Collecting diffq
  Using cached diffq-0.2.4-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl
Collecting Cython (from diffq)
  Using cached cython-3.1.2-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl.metadata (6.0 kB)
Requirement already satisfied: numpy in e:\synthalingua\synthalingua_main\data_whisper\lib\site-packages (from diffq) (1.26.4)
Requirement already satisfied: torch in e:\synthalingua\synthalingua_main\data_whisper\lib\site-packages (from diffq) (2.7.1+cu128)
[... installation continues ...]
Successfully installed Cython-3.1.2 diffq-0.2.4
((data_whisper) ) 
```

### Common Package Management Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pip list` | Show all installed packages |
| `pip show package_name` | Show details about a specific package |
| `pip install package_name` | Install a new package |
| `pip install --upgrade package_name` | Upgrade an existing package |
| `pip install --force-reinstall package_name` | Force reinstall a package |
| `pip uninstall package_name` | Remove a package |

### Troubleshooting Package Issues

**If a package won't install:**
1. Make sure you're in the `data_whisper` environment (check for `(data_whisper)` in prompt)
2. Try updating pip first: `pip install --upgrade pip`
3. Clear pip cache: `pip cache purge`
4. Try installing with no cache: `pip install --no-cache-dir package_name`

**If you get permission errors:**
- Don't run as administrator - this can break the environment
- Make sure no Synthalingua programs are running
- Check that your antivirus isn't blocking the installation

**If packages are corrupted or missing:**
1. Activate the environment: `./ffmpeg_path.bat`
2. Reinstall the problematic package: `pip install --force-reinstall package_name`
3. For demucs specifically: `pip install --force-reinstall demucs diffq`

### Verifying Your Installation

After installing packages manually, test that everything works:

```bash
# Test demucs installation
python -c "import demucs; print('Demucs working!')"

# Test diffq installation  
python -c "import diffq; print('Diffq working!')"

# Check torch and CUDA
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}, CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
```

### When to Use Manual Installation

**Use manual installation when:**
- `set_up_env.exe` reports package installation failures
- You get import errors when trying to use vocal isolation
- Specific packages are missing or corrupted
- You need to install additional dependencies for new features

**Don't use manual installation for:**
- Core tools like FFmpeg or yt-dlp (use `set_up_env.exe --reinstall` instead)
- Major environment recreation (use the setup tool)
- When you're unsure what went wrong (ask for help first)
