# Synthalingua Environment Setup Guide

This guide explains how to use the `set_up_env.exe` tool to set up and manage the Synthalingua environment. This tool is provided as a compiled executable for Windows users, so you do **not** need to run it with Python.

---

## What is `set_up_env.exe`?

`set_up_env.exe` is a one-stop setup utility for Synthalingua. It automates the download, installation, and configuration of all required tools:
- **FFmpeg** (audio/video processing)
- **yt-dlp** (video downloader)
- **7zr** (archive extractor)
- **Miniconda** (Python environment manager, for vocal isolation)
- **Demucs** (vocal isolation, optional)

It also creates a batch file (`ffmpeg_path.bat`) to set up your PATH and activate the correct environment for Synthalingua.

---

## How to Use `set_up_env.exe`

1. **Locate the Executable**
   - Find `set_up_env.exe` in your Synthalingua folder (usually in the main directory).

2. **DO NOT Run as Administrator (NOT Recommended)**
   - Click `set_up_env.exe` as is and just run.

3. **Follow the Prompts**
   - The tool is interactive. It will ask if you want to reuse existing tools, provide your own, or download fresh copies.
   - For a fresh install, just press Enter to accept defaults unless you have custom requirements.
   - **Miniconda Path Warning:**
     - It is strongly recommended to use the default Miniconda installation path.
     - If you must choose a custom location, make absolutely sure the path contains **NO SPACES**. Paths with spaces can cause installation and runtime errors with Miniconda and other tools.
     - The setup tool will warn you and prevent you from using a path with spaces.

---

## Command-Line Arguments

You can run `set_up_env.exe` from a terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) with the following options:

- `set_up_env.exe`  
  Basic setup (FFmpeg, yt-dlp, 7zr only)

- `set_up_env.exe --using_vocal_isolation`  
  Also installs Miniconda and Demucs for vocal isolation features

- `set_up_env.exe --reinstall`  
  Wipes tool folders/files and redownloads everything fresh

- `set_up_env.exe --reinstall --using_vocal_isolation`  
  Full reinstall, including vocal isolation tools

**Tip:** If you double-click the exe, it will prompt you interactively for these options.

---

## Keeping Your `data_whisper` Folder

The `data_whisper` folder contains your Miniconda environment and Demucs installation. To **preserve** your environment and avoid re-downloading large models or packages:

- **Do NOT use `--reinstall`** unless you want to wipe and start over.
- If prompted about removing `data_whisper` or Miniconda, choose **No** to keep your environment.
- You can safely update other tools (FFmpeg, yt-dlp, etc.) without affecting `data_whisper`.


### Example: Backing Up and Restoring Your Environment
#### Sample Interactive Session: Preserving Your Environment

When running `set_up_env.exe`, here's what you'll see and how to respond to preserve your environment:

**Fresh Install (First Time Running):**
```
üÜï Fresh installation detected!
For the best experience, we recommend setting up vocal isolation features.
Would you like to set up vocal isolation (demucs) along with the basic tools? (yes/no): yes

Miniconda will be installed to: C:\bin\Synthalingua\miniconda
Do you agree to install Miniconda to this path? (yes/no): yes

‚ö†Ô∏è  It is strongly recommended to use the default installation path for Miniconda.
   Changing the location is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.
   If you must choose a custom location, make sure the path contains NO SPACES.
Please enter a custom path for Miniconda installation (NO SPACES, recommended to keep the default): D:\My Custom Folder\miniconda
‚ùå Path cannot contain spaces. Please try again with a path that has NO SPACES.
Please enter a custom path for Miniconda installation (NO SPACES, recommended to keep the default): D:\MinicondaNoSpaces
```

**Existing Installation (Updating Tools):**
```
Found existing 7zr.exe. Use it or download fresh? (use/download): use
Do you already have FFmpeg? (yes/no): no
FFmpeg folder already exists, skipping download.
Do you already have yt-dlp? (yes/no): no
yt-dlp folder already exists, skipping download.
```

**Vocal Isolation Setup (Preserving Environment):**
```
A data_whisper environment already exists at C:\bin\Synthalingua\miniconda\envs\data_whisper.
Would you like to (k)eep, (r)ecreate, or (s)pecify a different environment? (keep/recreate/specify): keep
Using data_whisper environment at C:\bin\Synthalingua\miniconda\envs\data_whisper.
```

**Device Selection (During Setup):**
```
Synthalingua supports both CPU and GPU (CUDA) processing.
This affects both transcription and vocal isolation (demucs) performance.
Which device do you typically want to use with Synthalingua? (cpu/cuda): cuda
```

**Important:** Always answer `keep` when asked about environment options, and `yes` when asked about reusing assets. This preserves your models and packages.

To back up your environment:

1. Close all Synthalingua programs.
2. Copy the following folders to a safe location (e.g., an external drive or backup folder):
   - `data_whisper` (in your Synthalingua directory)
   - Miniconda install directory (default: `C:\bin\Synthalingua\miniconda`)

To restore your environment on the same or a new PC:

1. Copy both folders back to their original locations.
2. Run `set_up_env.exe` (without `--reinstall`) to update tool paths if needed.
3. Run `ffmpeg_path.bat` to activate the environment.

This will preserve all installed packages, models, and settings. You can use this method to migrate or recover your setup easily.

Do you already have yt-dlp? (yes/no): yes
Do you want to use the system default yt-dlp? (yes/no): yes
```

**Key Points:**
- Always answer `yes` when asked about reusing assets to preserve your environment
- Answer `keep` when asked about wiping/keeping Miniconda installation
- Answer `keep` when asked about environment options to preserve your models and packages
- The script remembers your choices and won't re-download unless you specifically request it
- Use `--reinstall` to update tools while preserving your environment by choosing the preserve options

## Script Details & Advanced Usage

- **Interactive Prompts:** The tool will ask if you want to reuse, download, or provide your own versions of each tool. This helps avoid unnecessary downloads and lets you use custom builds.
- **Batch File Creation:** After setup, a `ffmpeg_path.bat` file is created. Run this batch file to set up your PATH and activate the correct environment for Synthalingua.
- **Vocal Isolation:** If you enable vocal isolation, the tool installs Miniconda and Demucs, and sets up a `data_whisper` environment. You can choose CPU or CUDA (GPU) support during setup.
- **Safe Reinstallation:** The `--reinstall` flag lets you wipe and redownload tools. You will be prompted before deleting important folders like `data_whisper`.
- **Custom Paths:** You can specify a custom Miniconda install path if you do not want to use the default.
