Server Kill Utility

This utility can be used to force shutdown the Synthalingua web server
by deleting the server.pid file, which triggers the watchdog mechanism
to immediately terminate the Flask server.

Usage:
    python kill_server.py

This is useful when:
- The server hangs during "graceful shutdown"
- Ctrl+C doesn't work properly
- You need to force kill the server from another terminal/process
