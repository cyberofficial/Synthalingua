    """
    Send a message to a Discord channel through a webhook.

    Handles long messages by automatically chunking them into smaller pieces
    to comply with Discord's message length limits. Also includes basic rate
    limit detection and error handling.

    Args:
        webhook_url (str): The Discord webhook URL to send messages to
        text (str): The message text to send

    Note:
        - Messages longer than 1800 characters are automatically split into chunks
        - Prints warning messages for rate limits and failed deliveries
        - Discord's rate limits are detected via 429 status code responses

    Example:
        send_to_discord_webhook("https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...", "Hello World!")
